<h1>Description and Funcionalities</h1>

My professional website, where I tell my knowledge and what I basically do. HTML and CSS.
This site was made with html and css and is very simple, just a portfolio to show who i am.There's the part of who I am, my portfolios and technologies that I know how to use.
There are only two files, the HTML where the entire body of the site is and the CSS, where all the styling of the page is.
